[SEP] yeah , she'd always yell at me , even though i was the one in charge when our parents were away . [SEP] i don't get why it matters so much whether i clean my flat once a week or once a month . no one died from a bit of dust . [SEP] remind me to never stay at your place p [SEP] i'm somewhere in between . my house is always a mess , but i hate it when it's dirty . [SEP] what's the difference ? [SEP] i can't stand when there's dust , crumbs on the floor etc . , so i clean regularly . but i love it when all my stuff just lies around . when i put everything back on shelves or into cabinets , i keep on getting mad that i have to look for it , get up and take it out , and generally lose so much time . i like to have everything within my reach . [SEP] there's no better wardrobe than the armchair , right ? xd [SEP] i prefer the floor . there's more space on it d [SEP] just reading this gives me the creeps .

[SEP] no , i'm serious . i like your kids . and they're nice enough that if i ask them to do something , they actually do it d [SEP] lol , okay . actually , i think that when i tell them to go and help aunt meg with cleaning , they'll think it's fun . [SEP] and when you tell them to clean their own rooms , they say you're a monster ? d [SEP] exactly . but bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house . they don't even need to ask anymore , he simply knows it's his job . [SEP] do they pay him ? p [SEP] well , sometimes . but still i think he likes doing it . i don't know , maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well , he's just left alone to do his thing , so he feels like a man in the house in a way ? [SEP] tell them i can pay with cookies if they help me . [SEP] the famous chocolate cookies ? [SEP] why not ? i'm feeling generous today d [SEP] guys , i think i'm gonna change my mind about that beer . meg , would you accept one more helper ? d [SEP] you're always welcome ! but sorry boys , it's going to be a girls only event except for little billy . otherwise my house will never get cleaned today d [SEP] water [SEP] People often shout when they [SEP] leave [SEP] drop [SEP] board game [SEP] drop one's serve [SEP] turn a loss [SEP] move [SEP] playing a game [SEP] turn [SEP] climb [SEP] ready [SEP] enter [SEP] sound [SEP] a hockey game [SEP] start [SEP] playing a game with your friends [SEP] open a business [SEP] People strive to enjoy what they [SEP] get water [SEP] open your mouth [SEP] soap [SEP] a soap [SEP] wash [SEP] a wash cloth [SEP] a cloth [SEP] napkin [SEP] getting rid of dirt [SEP] polish [SEP] scrub [SEP] dining room [SEP] your family [SEP] get soap [SEP] the carpet [SEP] day [SEP] home [SEP] imma [SEP] ima [SEP] room [SEP] a computer [SEP] a carpet [SEP] nest [SEP] door [SEP] building [SEP] your bedroom [SEP] furniture [SEP] a family [SEP] the bedroom [SEP] furniture store [SEP] read the news [SEP] the family [SEP] washing dirt from between your toes [SEP] a building [SEP] nowadays [SEP] regret [SEP] present [SEP] news [SEP] yesterday [SEP] current [SEP] prehodiernal [SEP] tomorrow night [SEP] time [SEP] every time [SEP] constantly [SEP] e'er [SEP] incessantly [SEP] pronoun [SEP] family [SEP] daughter [SEP] at one time [SEP] once upon time [SEP] reach for it [SEP] receive [SEP] acquire [SEP] obtain [SEP] catch [SEP] earn [SEP] preempt [SEP] suffer [SEP] a desk [SEP] a plate [SEP] the table [SEP] your desk [SEP] having a party [SEP] time is money [SEP] use the information later [SEP] huffy [SEP] reach your arms out [SEP] canned food [SEP] a food can [SEP] pay attention [SEP] give a gift [SEP] time period [SEP] keeping track of time [SEP] love someone else [SEP] repeat it [SEP] virtual memory [SEP] mail a letter [SEP] going to a party [SEP] from time to time [SEP] pay bills [SEP] pay a bill [SEP] boy [SEP] level [SEP] number [SEP] a number [SEP] single [SEP] large indefinite quantity [SEP] indefinite [SEP] Too many Iraqi children [SEP] A drowned person [SEP] school a child [SEP] evening [SEP] a person [SEP] unpleasant person [SEP] feed a child [SEP] name children [SEP] name their baby [SEP] name a baby [SEP] name a child [SEP] name their children [SEP] dress a child [SEP] distance [SEP] telling many people about something [SEP] Some people [SEP] father [SEP] tax [SEP] straight and narrow [SEP] a single cat [SEP] father figure [SEP] a bed [SEP] A city [SEP] temporal location [SEP] your bed [SEP] nonstandard [SEP] the universe [SEP] cost [SEP] cry [SEP] liquid crystal [SEP] search [SEP] People [SEP] distressing [SEP] a table [SEP] disorder [SEP] a corner cupboard [SEP] a black hole [SEP] protest [SEP] relative quantity [SEP] food [SEP] departure [SEP] fine [SEP] sport [SEP] dad [SEP] western australia [SEP] untold [SEP]

jessie [SEP] steve [SEP] ron [SEP] michaela [SEP] so what do you guys think about the association idea ? [SEP] i might be lacking the context here [SEP] basically we were thinking of turning the club into an official association , so it's easier to get funds for events for example [SEP] i'm torn actually i get why it would help with funds , cooperation with other institutions and such , but i researched it and it involves quite a bit of paperwork . [SEP] and someone to take care of it permanently , cause it doesn't end at setting up the association you have to do it every year . [SEP] these are exactly the kind of things that i wanted to discuss with you . do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork ? doesn't have to be one person . [SEP] frankly , i don't see anyone doing this we all have jobs , barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility [SEP] the question is do the profits of being an association surpass the costs like the amount of time and work we put into it ? there are also some financial costs , are there ? [SEP] yeah , like a small fee when you set it up , but nothing more really . [SEP] so what do we get from it really ? [SEP] maybe the cost of a rubber stamp . [SEP] for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year , but to apply you need to be a formal association file_other [SEP] and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us , because we weren't an association [SEP] i think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually [SEP] i recall two as well [SEP] but do we truly need those subsidies ? we've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it , just with collective effort .

max [SEP] brian [SEP] daniel [SEP] ken [SEP] mark [SEP] jason [SEP] allen [SEP] tom [SEP] rawiri [SEP] david [SEP] virginia [SEP] jeremy [SEP] din anyone actually watch this the video ? [SEP] link_video [SEP] research shows that long term cannabis use via smoke inhalation produces no noticeable long term consequences whereas tobacco use leads to copd ect . but cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath . but these subside when cannabis smoking ceases . [SEP] wrong , it wasn't long term use , but rather an occasional low cumulative , which could be something like smoking once or twice a month . [SEP] tom you didn t watch the video . [SEP] i was just about to complain , then i saw your post . thanks . ; [SEP] i like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody i know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well . [SEP] short attention span [SEP] daniel probably from pot [SEP] jason he does rewatch the end man . he doesn t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other . [SEP] jason , i used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer , and i know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco . [SEP] jason hollis yuck . . . why even ? ? ? [SEP] i know that a joint is bigger than a roach , so is a spliff bigger than a joint ? [SEP] i don t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll ups except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll up . i say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time . some spliffs may be big some joints be small . . . [SEP] allen so quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues . [SEP] btw seeing it's still illegal at a federal level , i'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally . propaganda . keep gobbling those opiate based pills , they're fine [SEP] this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis . it's not saying cannabis is harmful . . . there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates . [SEP] really ? putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system . . . . . shocker . oil . . . . edibles . . . many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it .
