[SEP] i still prefer facebook . had twitter once , but the interaction with others is nothing compared with facebook . [SEP] well , it's intended in a completely different way .

[SEP] not 4 me . i don't post that many pictures online . [SEP] but u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering . there are also companies on instagram . [SEP] i know , but i'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast . [SEP] that's not all ppl post on instagram ! [SEP] so , what else ? [SEP] depends on ur interest . i , for one , like to observe all the fitness accounts [SEP] and does this motivate u to train ? [SEP] no , but it gives me hints what to do and what not .

[SEP] i never even imagined he might be gay ! surely not . but there must be sth else . [SEP] we think he's just so obsessively career minded . nothing else counts for him . [SEP] he's always been very strong willed . and he knows what he wants . well if i were you i wouldn't worry at all . [SEP] you're probably right . but you know i'd love it so much to have plenty of grandchildren around me .

betty [SEP] andy [SEP] hello . i have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room . [SEP] hello andy . thank you for that , what are your thoughts ? [SEP] i think it is caused by condensation , as most of the moist settles on and around the windows . [SEP] why is that ? [SEP] those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water . on the windows its just water , on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow . [SEP] so why is it all over the spare room walls , and all around the dining room ? but not in other rooms ? [SEP] probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls . [SEP] so why only that bedroom and not the other ones ? [SEP] i guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen . [SEP] but why isnt there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then ? [SEP] i think that is because the kitchen doesn't have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it . the difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees . [SEP] does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation ? [SEP] not necessarily . that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house , so it would just settle somewhere else . [SEP] so what would you recommend ? [SEP] i would install a fan system , or piv system , which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air . it would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night . [SEP] that sounds good . would that be sufficient ? [SEP] if you buy a decent size it will be , but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould . that will not go away by itself . [SEP] ok , is this something your company can help with ? [SEP] it is indeed , we can repaint as well if you want . [SEP] good point . could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email ? [SEP] of course , i will have that done by friday . [SEP] that would be great . and again , thanks for today !

bobby [SEP] mickey [SEP] u know what annoys me the most ? [SEP] not being able to watch tv or listen to music without pesky interruptions ? [SEP] that too , but the thing that annoys me the most is pharmaceuticals , medicine and drugs . [SEP] y ? aren't they good 4 ur health ? [SEP] they may well be , but not for my wallet ! [SEP] what do u mean ? [SEP] i was watching a film last night and suddenly there's a bunch of commercial of different medical products and so on . [SEP] and what of it ? [SEP] imagine that pharmaceutical companies invent illnesses ! [SEP] what ? are u sure ? [SEP] no , i'm not , but in the commercial they mentioned a name of an illness i have never heard of . [SEP] so what ? there are many illnesses and diseases i've never heard of . [SEP] so i did some research . turns out such a thing does not exist . no medical journal writes about it , no medical forum suggests caution . [SEP] that doesn't mean it doesn't exist . [SEP] i even found a youtube video of a doctor explaining y it's not an illness . [SEP] all right , this is quite serious . [SEP] so i put my mind to it and do u know what i came up with ? [SEP] what ? [SEP] that in this particular case they're selling mints as medical products ! [SEP] srsly ? ! [SEP] absolutely ! [SEP] how long do u think they've been lying to us ? [SEP] can't be sure , but probably 4ever . imagine every illness , disease and so on . where do these come from ? why do they spread so fast ? [SEP] that is kinda puzzling . [SEP] right ?
